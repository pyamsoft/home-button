## What is Home Button

Home Button is a small android application which originally served as
a learning experience for the author's first venture into Android development.
It has since evolved into a full fledged application while keeping to its
simplistic roots.

Home Button launches a simple notification at the top of the screen, which
the user can select to immediately be brought back to the device Home screen.
Home Button creates a single persistent notification that is accessable from
any application as long as the notification drawer is expandable.

## Development

Home Button is developed in the Open on GitHub at:  
```
https://github.com/pyamsoft/home-button
```
If you know a few things about Android programming and are wanting to help
out with development you can do so by creating issue tickets to squash bugs,
and propose feature requests for future inclusion.`

# Issues or Questions

Please post any issues with the code in the Issues section on GitHub. Pull Requests
will be accepted on GitHub only after extensive reading and as long as the request
goes in line with the design of the application. Pull Requests will only be
accepted for new features of the application, for general purpose bug fixes, creating
an issue is simply faster.
